Make Rest API endpoints integrations in minutes with StepZen.

## Getting Started

This project consists of three collections in Firestore.

- Owner
- Event
- Attendee

## API Endpoints using NextJS pages/api.

Deploy this app in Vercel to expose the endpoints.

I recommend deploying by connecting your github repo to a vercel account, https://vercel.com/new.

## Configure StepZen

The REST endpoints are set up, https://eventdemo.vercel.app/api and ready to be linked in the StepZen schema.

Sign up for a StepZen endpoint here, https://stepzen.com/signup.

After getting started, deploy the stepzen endpoint in the `/stepzen` folder and include the url and api key in your `.env` file.

## Learn More

The example above highlights the ease of linking data together to provide value to an event owner. Obviously for a production ready dashboard, a login experience is required. We focused on the backend logic rather than the frontend authentication flow.

If you are interested in setting up a full dashboard experience, a tutorial is in the works. Follow me on twitter for updates, (@isaacwgarcia)[https://twitter.com/isaacwgarcia].

You can find more example repositories at the [StepZen Github](http://github.com/stepzen-dev). If you're not already signed up for StepZen, you can sign up [here](https://www.stepzen.com/signup).
